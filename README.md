# springboot
* A practice project made with springboot. 
* I have a single customer api with all CRUD operations.
* I have used mysql as my database.
* I have used junit 5 with mockito for testing.


How to run the project:
* Clone the project.
* Update the application.properties with your mysql database credentials (including the correct databse name and port number)
* Start the application 
* Using your browser or postman navigate to any of the api end points (for example localhost:8080/getallcustomers)

How to run the tests:
* The tests can be found under src/tests/customerservicetests
* Make sure you have junit 5 configured as your test runner. 
* Run the tests.
